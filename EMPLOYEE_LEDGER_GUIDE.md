## Automatic Transaction Recording

### Advance Transactions
When an advance is created:
```javascript
// In Advance.js create method
const ledgerData = {
  employeeId: advanceData.employeeId,
  transactionType: 'ADVANCE',
  debitAmount: advanceData.amount,
  creditAmount: 0,
  referenceId: advanceId,
  referenceType: 'ADVANCE',
  referenceDescription: `${advanceData.advanceType} Advance - ${advanceData.reason}`,
  periodMonth: advanceData.deductionMonth,
  createdBy: advanceData.createdBy
};
await Ledger.createEntry(ledgerData);
```

### Loan Transactions
When a loan is created:
```javascript
// In Loan.js create method
const ledgerData = {
  employeeId: loanData.employeeId,
  transactionType: 'LOAN',
  debitAmount: loanData.loanAmount,
  creditAmount: 0,
  referenceId: loanId,
  referenceType: 'LOAN',
  referenceDescription: `${loanData.loanType} Loan - ${loanData.reason}`,
  createdBy: loanData.createdBy
};
await Ledger.createEntry(ledgerData);
```

### Deduction Transactions
When a deduction is created:
```javascript
// In Deduction.js create method
const ledgerData = {
  employeeId: deductionData.employeeId,
  transactionType: 'DEDUCTION',
  debitAmount: deductionData.amount,
  creditAmount: 0,
  referenceId: deductionId,
  referenceType: 'DEDUCTION',
  referenceDescription: `${deductionData.deductionType} - ${deductionData.reason}`,
  periodMonth: deductionData.effectiveFromMonth,
  createdBy: deductionData.appliedBy
};
await Ledger.createEntry(ledgerData);
```

### Payroll Transactions
When payroll is processed:
```javascript
// In Payroll.js createPayrollDetail method
const ledgerData = {
  employeeId: payrollData.employeeId,
  transactionType: 'PAYROLL',
  debitAmount: 0,
  creditAmount: payrollData.netSalary,
  referenceId: payrollId,
  referenceType: 'PAYROLL',
  referenceDescription: `Payroll for ${periodName} - Net Salary`,
  periodMonth: periodName,
  createdBy: payrollData.createdBy
};
await Ledger.createEntry(ledgerData);
```

## Balance Calculation

The system automatically calculates running balances:

```javascript
// Get current balance
const currentBalance = await Ledger.getCurrentBalance(employeeId);

// Calculate new balance
const newBalance = currentBalance + creditAmount - debitAmount;

// Store with transaction
await Ledger.createEntry({
  ...transactionData,
  balance: newBalance
});
```

```javascript
const response = await api.post('/ledger/entries', {
  employeeId: 1,
  transactionType: 'ADJUSTMENT',
  debitAmount: 500,
  referenceDescription: 'Manual adjustment for late fee'
});
```

### 4. Export Ledger Data

- Login with your credentials
- Start exploring employee ledgers

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Reconciliation
- Review ledger balances monthly
- Cross-check with payroll reports
- Verify automatic entries

### 2. Manual Entries
- Use manual entries sparingly
- Always provide clear descriptions
- Document reasons for adjustments

### 3. Data Export
- Export data regularly for backup
- Use exports for external reporting
- Maintain audit trails

### 4. User Permissions
- Restrict manual entry creation to authorized users
- Implement approval workflows for large adjustments
- Log all manual entries

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Balance Mismatch
**Problem**: Employee balance doesn't match expected amount
**Solution**: 
- Check for missing transactions
- Verify automatic entry creation
- Review manual adjustments

#### 2. Missing Transactions
**Problem**: Expected transactions not appearing
**Solution**:
- Check if related records exist (advance, loan, etc.)
- Verify automatic entry creation in models
- Check database constraints

#### 3. Performance Issues
**Problem**: Slow loading of ledger data
**Solution**:
- Implement pagination
- Add database indexes
- Optimize queries

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check ledger table structure
SELECT * FROM HRMS_LEDGER WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;

# Check employee balance
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SUM(CREDIT_AMOUNT - DEBIT_AMOUNT) as BALANCE 
FROM HRMS_LEDGER 
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 1 AND STATUS = 'ACTIVE';

# Check transaction types
SELECT DISTINCT TRANSACTION_TYPE FROM HRMS_LEDGER;
```

## Future Enhancements
